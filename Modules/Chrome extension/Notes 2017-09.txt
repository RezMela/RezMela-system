[04:48] Ramesh: @jfhopkin Just got two pano links for you to test (if you have time). The first is a picture in New Zeland before an earthquake, and the next is after the event.

[04:51] Ramesh: In this case, it appears that the panoIDs are different so looks like we won't even need to extract the time parameter (in any case, as far as I can see, the street view api does not return this value yet, I have subscribed to the issue to get notifications if Google fixes it)
