ROOF


Y coords for roof

inside 1.0 - 0.174 Y
outside 1.0 - 0.151 Y (but UV square, 0.0 - 1.0 on both axes?)
ridge 0.5 - 0.54 Y

FOUNDATIONS, etc

Foundation is slightly taller than 0.8m? Stuff rezzed on it is Z=75.05050m, etc

Maybe courtyard flagstones?

GENERAL TEXTURING

My objects tend to need a 2x2 repeat on the solid wood
Also, solid wood isn't tileable
Sooo, use solid wood to make new texture that is double dense and also tiles

Maybe some shading needed? Gable ends especially


STAIRCASE

Narrow side should use basic wood texture (but keep UV placement).
   This will need a different side number for the appropriate Stickpoint!
Make a flipped  one


CEILING/FLOOR 

Have beams/joists underneath?


DOORS

Sounds? Handy must have a good open/close pair


ADDITIONAL OBJECTS FROM PACK

Reorganise naming of all objects, set categories.

Different types of window
Different types of wall

FIREPLACE

Needs chimney section, and should stack vertically


OTHER IDEAS

Double doors!?
Another one with retexture for black&white half-timber exterior
