In testing, I've found something else that's not quite right. Sometimes when you first load a scene containing text display objects, clicks on the hamburger are ignored because the text display script doesn't know that someone is signed into the App. This needs further investigation.

Load scene 'John'.

LoggedId is null in the projector, but apparently not in the Text display C.
